# Spotify-data-analysis-and-genre-prediction
Spotify is one of the largest music streaming services all over the world. With 271 million monthly active users, including 124 million paying subscribers, it is the ideal platform for artists to reach their audience. 
At the heart of Spotify lives a massive and growing data-set. What if we could analyze the music we listen to using Data Science?

In this analysis, I would mine the nuggets of insight hidden beneath mountains of Spotify data. In doing so, gain a greater understanding of the type of genres, 
tracks and artists the consumers have been listening to on Spotify.

Broadly, we will be performing the following steps to accomplish the project objectives:

1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis:
2. Visulization of audio feaftures of different genres
3. Correlation between features
4. Popular artists within each genre
5. Generate Insights:
6. Trends of popular features in the past decade
7. Variability of characteristics across genres
8. Apply k-means clustering algorithm
9. Apply Hierarchical clustering algorithm
10. Use elbow curve which helps to find the optimum number of clusters

This analysis can help understand consumer behavior and suggest what music are they looking for and hence provide direction to artists and music producers.
